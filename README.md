## Installation

## Standalone

1. Install **effector-inspector**

```bash
npm install --dev effector-inspector
```

or

```bash
yarn add -D effector-inspector
```

2. Make sure, that you have either [`effector/babel-plugin`](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/babel-plugin/) or [`@effector/swc-plugin`](https://github.com/effector/swc-plugin) set up in your project. These plugins add metadata to all effector's units, which is then used by effector-inspector.

Check out the documentation of [`effector/babel-plugin`](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/babel-plugin/) or [`@effector/swc-plugin`](https://github.com/effector/swc-plugin).

3. Initialize `inspector` in your application's entrypoint (something like `index.ts` or `client.tsx`).

```ts
import {createInspector} from 'effector-inspector';

createInspector();
```

4. After that inspector is ready to work, but it does not know about any units yet. You also need to attach inspector to units.

One way to do it is to attach inspector to units manually:

```ts
import {attachInspector} from 'effector-inspector';

// single units
attachInspector($store);
attachInspector(event);
attachInspector(effectFx);
// or list of them
attachInspector([
  $store,
  event,
  effectFx,
  // any number of units in the list
]);
// or by domain
attachInspector(someDomain);
```

### effector-root

The `effector-root` library can be used for convenience, as it provides common root domain for all units.

```ts
// index.ts
import {attachInspector, createInspector} from 'effector-inspector';
import {root} from 'effector-root';

createInspector();
attachInspector(root);
```

Check out `effector-root` [documentation here](https://github.com/effector/root#how-to-auto-replace-all-imports-of-effector-to-effector-root-using-babel-plugin).

## As a part of effector-logger

1. Install effector, logger and **inspector**

```bash
npm install effector
npm install --dev effector-logger effector-inspector
```

or yarn

```bash
yarn add effector
yarn add -D effector-logger effector-inspector
```

2. Follow instructions for [effector-logger](https://github.com/sergeysova/effector-logger#installation)

- Setup babel plugin
- Replace `effector` to `effector-logger`

3. Open your root application file (something like `client.tsx` or `index.tsx`)

Initialize effector logger in it first lines.

```ts
import {createInspector} from 'effector-inspector';

createInspector();
```

4. Press hot keys to open inspector

By default: `CTRL+B` in your application

5. Watch your stores and its values
